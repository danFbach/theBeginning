My name is Dan Fehrenbach and this is my story!
I am extremely excited to continue learning about software development. It is a passion of mine and computers have been a main part of my life for many years and I plan to continue working with them for the rest of my life. Working with technology is a skill in which you can never master or know everything, which makes it infinitely interesting and intriguing. Thats all I have for the first day at DCC. FIN.
